# Sign-Language-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
Sign Language Prediction system for communicating with deaf and dumb people

##Instructions for running the code##

1-Image Paths needs to be set for each different folder for different gestures if the images need to be captured.

2-New folder Path should be set for saving the preprocessed images in that folder.

3-For Training and testing purpose set the path of the preprocessed data.

4-For using the pre-trained CNN model for prediction set the path for the .h5 file in the last cell code.

5-Pre-trained model can be used or the same dataset can be found on kaggle.
