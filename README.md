Sign Language Prediction system for communicating with deaf and dumb people

##Instructions for executing and understanding the Sign language prediction system.##

1-Image Paths needs to be set for each different folder for different gestures if the images need to be captured.

2-New folder Path should be set for saving the preprocessed images in that folder.

3-For Training and testing purpose set the path of the preprocessed data.

4-For using the pre-trained CNN model for prediction set the path for the .h5 file in the last cell code.

5-Pre-trained model which is stored in CNNmodel.h5 file can be used for prediction or the same dataset can be found on kaggle.

6-The Gesture Images folder consists of the images of the gestures which are included in the dataset. There are total 37 hand sign gestures.

7-The Gesture preprocessed Images folder consists of the images of the gestures in the preprocessed dataset.

8-Demo.mp4 is a video showing the final prediction results.

9-finalcode.ipynb file is a jupyter notebook python file which includes the entire code from capturing of the dataset to the CNN model training and prediction using OpenCV.

10-For successful execution of this code one should follow the 1-5 instructions.
